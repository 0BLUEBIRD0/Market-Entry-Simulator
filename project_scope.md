Market Entry Simulator: Project Scope
Objective
To evaluate the feasibility and profitability of Tesla entering the Indian electric vehicle (EV) market in 2026, delivering data-driven insights and strategic recommendations to guide decision-making.
Scope
This project analyzes the Indian EV market, focusing on market size, consumer demand, competitor dynamics, and regulatory risks. Using descriptive and predictive analytics, we will forecast Tesla’s potential market share, revenue, and breakeven timeline under multiple scenarios (optimistic, baseline, pessimistic). An interactive simulator dashboard will allow users to adjust key inputs (e.g., pricing, investment) to explore outcomes.
Assumptions

India’s economy grows at 6–7% annually through 2026, supporting EV adoption.
Tesla establishes local manufacturing in India by 2026, reducing costs (aligned with Tesla’s 2023 India plans).
EV charging infrastructure expands by 25% year-over-year, driven by government policies.
Middle-class income growth fuels demand for premium EVs.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Market Size: Projected Indian EV market value in 2026 (USD).
Market Share: Tesla’s potential share (%) within 2–5 years.
ROI: Return on investment for market entry (capital expenditure, marketing, operations).
Breakeven Year: Time to recover initial investment.
Risks: Regulatory hurdles, competition intensity, infrastructure gaps.

Timeline

Phase 1: Problem Definition (Days 1–2): Define scope and KPIs.
